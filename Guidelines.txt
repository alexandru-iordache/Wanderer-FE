Comms with IMPORTANT are TODO items

.ts class configs:
    - declare first Input/Output elements, after that the ViewChild

TBD IMPORTANT:
   x - autocomplete in create-trip-modal
   x - interface for the google maps info window
   - mechanism to add cities from the panel
    x - autocomplete for cityName
      - accomodation idea (later maybe) (when nigths > 0 show accomodation field ??)
    x - waypoint list for city per day (mechansim to count the days and make multiple views for each day)
    x - markers

   x - redirect from the info window to the panel with the city selected
   x - see the problem why only one city emitted by the map is shown
   x - once the city is clicked from the panel or the city added is saved, block on the city view on maps(Google Maps Style Swap)
        - on click situation is done, remains to put it after the add situation
      x - create WayPoints structure
        - stop default infoWindows when the listener is disabled
   x - city map lock
   x - Investigate City Panel and Page communication error
     - drag and drop cities (rearrange the dates)

    - add waypoint
      x - restrict autocomplete
      x - come up with an hour/minutes idea (restrict to not begin before the last time entered in the past city/following city)
        x - validations needed
        x - little redesign to minutes/hour
        - icons rendering for the 3 waypoint types
        - mechanism to attentionate the overlapping intervals (maybe also in the edit waypoint)
      x - render waypoint markers
        - waypoint infoWindows
      x - close waypoint list view
      x - custom overlay not showing up after closing the city view

    - tweaks and improvements
      - danger-text in validations
      -  
    
    - edit/delete
    x - style the delete confirmation modal
    x - stop click event on the button when you click delete/edit
      - edit flow
        x - see new validation bug (no result does not show for city that is not from autocomplete)
        x - waypoint edit
        x - discard -> change edit flow
        - snackbar error for waypoints that will be deleted
    x - reshape list after delete (CITY)
      - add button focus on enter

    - refactoring
      x - investigate also the map component, subscribe to relevant events
      x - investigate listener bug (after city view the listner is not initialized)
        - investigate city to add bug

    - see token refresh bug
    - verify update flow (style the icon for info panel)
      - change path if succesfull at create (so it loads the trip from the DB) 

TBD:
    - Review my trip AI
    - Enhance CreateTrip panel 
    - DateTime picker solution
  x - validation for add city component
  x - validation for add waypoint component
    - refactor the create-trip-modal
  x - see the doouble click problem on the x Overlay 
    - change font in overlay, marker
    - change maps cursor over a locality??
    - rename AddCityDto maybe??
  D - refactor ngOnChanges (every change should come with its method) (Discarded since we have a trip state service now)
