.ts class configs:
    - declare first Input/Output elements, after that the ViewChild

     - interface for the google maps info window
     - mechanism to add cities from the panel
     - redirect from the info window to the panel with the city selected
   x - see the problem why only one city emitted by the map is shown

TBD:
    - refactor the create-trip-modal
