Comms with IMPORTANT are TODO items

.ts class configs:

TBD IMPORTANT:
   x - autocomplete in create-trip-modal
   x - interface for the google maps info window
   - mechanism to add cities from the panel
    x - autocomplete for cityName
      - accomodation idea (later maybe) (when nigths > 0 show accomodation field ??)
    x - waypoint list for city per day (mechansim to count the days and make multiple views for each day)
    x - markers

   x - redirect from the info window to the panel with the city selected
   x - see the problem why only one city emitted by the map is shown
   x - once the city is clicked from the panel or the city added is saved, block on the city view on maps(Google Maps Style Swap)
        - on click situation is done, remains to put it after the add situation
      x - create WayPoints structure
        - stop infoWindows when the listener is disabled
   x - city map lock
   x - Investigate City Panel and Page communication error
     - drag and drop cities (rearrange the dates)

     - add waypoint
      x - restrict autocomplete
        - come up with an hour/minutes idea (restrict to not begin before the last time entered in the past city/following city)
        - render waypoint markers
        - waypoint infoWindows
        - close waypoint list view
